# What if?

My messy notebook, built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). Maybe it is unsuitable for humans to read.

I built this notebook with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) formerly (see it on [`gridsome`](https://github.com/Renovamen/what-if/tree/gridsome) branch). I love and appreciate Gridsome, however, I had to suffer from some problems due to its bugs when using it. Finally, I realized that I just need a light and simple notebook, so I move to VuePress.

See this notebook [here](https://note.zxh.io/).
