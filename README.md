# What if?

My messy notebook, built with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/). Maybe it is unsuitable for humans to read.

## Usage

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at http://localhost:8080/
npm run dev # gridsome develop

# build for production with minification
npm run build # gridsome build
```
