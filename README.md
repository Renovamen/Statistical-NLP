# What if?

My messy notebook, built with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/). Maybe it is unsuitable for humans to read.

Check out this notebook [here](https://notebook.renovamen.ink).

## Usage

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

## Notes

For `gridsome`, here I use [this version](https://gitee.com/Renovamen/gridsome) (see [package.json](package.json)). It was forked from Gridsome `v0.7.15` and modified a little. Refer to the link for more details.
